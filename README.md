In this program, three objects of type ComplexÂ are created and user is asked to enter the real and imaginary parts for two complex numbers which are stored in objects c1 and c2.

Then statement result = c1 -c 2 is executed. This statement invokes the operator function Complex operator - (Complex c2).

When result = c1 - c2 is executed, c2 is passed as argument to the operator function.
